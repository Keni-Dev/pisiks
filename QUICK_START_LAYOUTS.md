# Quick Start - Responsive Layout Features

## 🎯 What's New?

Your physics simulator now has **3 layout modes** that make it work great on mobile, tablet, and desktop!

## 🔄 Three Layout Modes

### 1. **Side-by-Side** (DEFAULT ✅)
- **Perfect for:** Mobile phones & tablets
- Canvas and data side-by-side on big screens
- Stacks vertically on mobile automatically
- **This is now the default!**

### 2. **Overlay**
- **Perfect for:** Presentations & screenshots
- Data floats over the canvas corner
- Clean, minimal look
- Great for sharing

### 3. **Classic**
- **Perfect for:** Desktop users
- Original layout you're used to
- Controls and data below canvas
- Side-by-side panels

## 📱 How to Switch Layouts

Look at the **top right** of your screen in the header.

You'll see three buttons:
- **[Side]** - Side-by-side layout (mobile-friendly)
- **[Overlay]** - Data overlays canvas
- **[Classic]** - Original bottom layout

Just **click** one to switch! Your choice is saved automatically.
